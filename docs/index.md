This site documents how to operate and construct the Ingolia lab
turbidostat.

[Operating the turbidostat](./operation.html). Prior to starting a
continuous culture, a growth chamber and a media reservoir are
assembled and sterilized. The sterile reservoir is then filled with
media. These fluidics are then assembled into the turbidostat
controller: the growth chamber goes into a turbidity detector and the
media line is inserted into a peristaltic pump. At this point, the
controller can be used to fill the growth chamber with media, and it
can be inoculated to start the culture.

[Constructing the turbidostat](./construction.html). Building the
turbidostat requires assembling a custom PCB and mounting it in a 3D
printed housing. The turbidostat also requires fluidics that are
constructed using readily accessible plastic fittings and silicone
tubing.
