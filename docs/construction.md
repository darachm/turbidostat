## Constructing the Turbidostat

The turbidostat comprises several subsystems that work together to
maintain continuous culture. A custom printed circuit board (PCB)
carries out turbidity measurements by controlling an LED light source
and detecting the faint scattered light signal from the culture. This
PCB also controls pumps that add new media to the culture. A
3D-printed housing holds the scattered light detector firmly in place
on the side of the growth chamber, an ordinary glass media bottle. A
collection of fluidics ensures that sterile air is constantly
delivered to the growth chamber, and adds new media while removing
waste culture.
