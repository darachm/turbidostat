## Constructing the Turbidostat

The turbidostat comprises several subsystems that work together to
maintain continuous culture. A custom printed circuit board (PCB)
carries out turbidity measurements by controlling an LED light source
and detecting the faint scattered light signal from the culture. This
PCB also controls pumps that add new media to the culture. A
3D-printed housing holds the scattered light detector firmly in place
on the side of the growth chamber, an ordinary glass media
bottle. Fluidics hardware, consisting of readily available plastic
fittings and silicone tubing, delivers media along with sterile air to
the growth chamber, and removes waste.

### [Electronics](./construction-electronics.html)

The electronics comprise a custom printed circuit board that is
assembled, and then connected to a pre-built microcontroller, an
[Adafruit Feather M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2772). The PCB
can be ordered from a fabrication service, and a collection of
electronic components are then soldered onto the PCB. This includes
circuits for turbidity measurement by light scattering, along with
circuits that allow the microcontroller to drive the pump motors. The
scattered light detector itself is mounted on the _bottom_ of the PCB,
while the illumination LED is connected through a pair of wires
allowing it to be mounted on the side of the growth chamber. A barrel
jack connector is used to connect the PCB to a wall adaptor supplying
enough current to run the pump motors.

The microcontroller attaches to the circuit board using "headers" --
conductive metal pins soldered to the microcontroller board that fit
into aligned sockets installed on the custom PCB. The microcontroller
has a USB connector that allows it to be programmed using Arduino
software on an ordinary computer, and also to report data while it is
running.

### [Housing](./construction-housing.html)

The custom PCB and microcontroller are mounted in a custom 3D printed
housing, which attaches to a 3D printed band that enricles the growth
chamber. The entire housing and band are painted very flat black in
order to minimize unwanted, background reflections or stray light. The
light detector (photodiode) fits into a narrow hole on the band, while
the LED is mounted in another hole situated on the side of the band. A
sterilized growth chamber is seated into the band, which holds it in
place and provides stable turbidity measurements.

### [Pump](./construction-pump.html)

Peristaltic pumps offers two substantial advantages in the
turbidostat. Firstly, the fluid is never exposed to the pump itself,
only to the thin silicone tubing that fits into the pump. Thus, the
tubing can be sterilized easily and there is no need to sterilize the
electrical or mechanical parts of the pump. Secondly, the peristaltic
pump delivers a very reproducible amount of liquid each second it is
switched on, making it easy to control the rate of media delivery
precisely.

The peristaltic pump is mounted in a custom 3D printed stand. We
connect the pump motor to the PCB using a cable with a JST
connector. This connector is polarized, ensuring that the pump cannot
be connected backwards. We use a screw terminal to connect one short
end of the JST cable to the PCB, and another screw terminal to connect
a longer length of cable to the pump and housing.

### [Fluidics](./construction-fluidics.html)

The growth chamber and the media reservoir are both built using
standard glass media bottles with GL45 caps having threaded ports,
often used for HPLC. The growth chamber has rigid plastic tubing
extending into the culture for aeration, inoculation / sampling, and
waste. On the outside of the cap, we attach short lengths of silicone
tubing to the top of the rigid plastic using silicone sealant. Other
than this connection, we use barbed Luer-lock connectors for all of
the tubing.

The growth chamber receives a steady stream of sterile air that passes
first through a 0.2 Âµm disc filter and then bubbles through sterile
water. The air scrubber is constructed from a side-arm flask with
rigid tubing extending down through a stopper. The disk filter is
attached on the top, and sterile humidified air emerges from the side
connector. Silicone tubing connects this side connector to the air
inflow port on the growth chamber lid. The air bubbles through the
culture and maintains a constant flow and slightly positive
pressure. This air flows continuously out of the waste line, which we
configure to pass through an S-shaped trap and then hang freely in a
waste recepticle. When media addition raises the culture volume to the
level of the bottom of the waste tube, excess culture is forced out by
the air flow. The combination of continuous airflow and the S-shaped
bend protects the culture from contamination.

Another piece of silicone tubing delivers media from the
reservoir. This tubing has a section of thin peristaltic pump tubing
with thicker tubing on each side. The far end connects to the media
reservoir, where a long, semi-rigid tube withdraws media. The
reservoir also has a filtered vent for pressure equalization and a
third port to add sterilized media.
