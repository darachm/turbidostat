#### [Sterilizing the media reservoir and growth chamber](sterilization.html). 

   The growth chamber and air scrubber are assembled together with
   most of the media and waste tubing and sterilized together. The
   media reservoir is pre-assembled and sterilized as well. Both of
   these components can be sterilized well in advance.

   Optionally, the media reservoir and growth chamber can be
   pre-connected and sterilized together. This avoids the need to
   connect any tubing after sterilization, but moving the fully
   assembled system can be awkward.
   
#### [Filling the media reservoir](media-fill.html). 
   
   The media reservoir can be filled in advance and stored as
   appropriate for the specific liquid media used in the
   experiment. The media reservoir can also be refilled during
   operation, and the media source can be switched between reservoirs
   to change culture conditions.
   
#### [Starting a turbidostat culture](turbidostat.html).

   Once the growth chamber is sterilized and the media reservoir is
   filled, the turbidostat can be assembled, filled, and inoculated to
   begin a continuous culture.

#### [Dissassembly and cleanup](cleanup.html).

   After operation, the turbidostat is disassembled and washed.
