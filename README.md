[Visit the homepage](https://ingolia-lab.github.io/turbidostat/) for a guide to the turbidostat system.

The [`docs`](docs) directory contains documentation for [building](docs/construction.md) and [operating](docs/operation.md) the turbidostat.

The [`design`](design) directory contains source files needed to build the turbidostat. Within this directory,
* The [`circuit`](design/circuit) directory contains printed circuit board design files and a list of components
* The [`housing`](design/housing) directory contains STL files needed to construct the turbidity detector housing by 3-D printing
* The [`firmware`](design/firmware) directory contains Arduino source for the turbidostat controller software

The [`analysis`](analysis) directory contains useful scripts for analyzing the data logs produced by the turbidostat.

The [`mcgeachy-2018`](mcgeachy-2018) directory contains raw data and analysis scripts for McGeachy et al., 2018.
