The [`analysis.sh`](analysis.sh) script in this directory will
download aligned sequence data in BAM format from the NCBI SRA and
tabulate reading frame statistics. Note that the raw data files are
~22 GB and the analysis produces another ~9 GB of data files.

The [`analysis-framing.R`](analysis-framing.R) script in this
directory processes the data files tabulated by `analysis.sh` and
plots the graphs for the manuscript. It should be run within the data
directory populated by `analysis.sh`. The relevant data files from the
manuscript are in the `results` folder, and so running the following
command in that directory will plot the graphs.
```
R --no-save < ../analysis-framing.R
```

The [`align.sh`](align.sh) script is provided for reference -- the SRA
data comprises aligned reads in BAM format and so alignment isn't
required. This script aligns paired-end FastQ data to a reference
comprising the yeast genome along with the sequence of TagBFP. The
script must be edited to insert the correct paths for directories
containing FastQ files and genome references. It also assumes that the
FastQ file names match the names produced by the Illumina basecalling
software.
