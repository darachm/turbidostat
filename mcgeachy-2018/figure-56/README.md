The [`barcodes.sh`](barcodes.sh) script will download the barcode
sequencing data from the NCBI SRA, trim the reads, and process them to
link barcodes with variants. This script will then run
[`analysis.R`](analysis.R) in order to determine how different
variants affect fitness and plot graphs. This analysis depends on
barcode counting data generated by
[`../figure-4def/count.sh`](../figure-4def/count.sh), and these two
scripts can run in the same working directory.

The script will download ~6 GB of sequencing data and generate ~14 GB
of alignment and analysis files in its working directory.

```
cd figure-4def
mkdir /path/to/data
./count.sh /path/to/data
cd ../figure-56
./barcodes.sh /path/to/data
```

Barcode-to-variant assignment relies on the [`../cyh2`](../cyh2)
project, a collection of compiled [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
programs that handle barcode counting and assignment. The Rust
environment [must be
installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html) in order to
compile and run them.
