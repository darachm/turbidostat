The [`analysis-tstat.R`](analysis-tstat.R) script will process the
data log from the turbidostat in
[`screenlog-tstat.txt`](screenlog-tstat.txt) and plot graphs of the
turbidostat.

A preliminary version of the turbidostat firmware was used for this
experiment and so the turbidostat configuration and the data format in
[`screenlog-tstat.txt`](screenlog-tstat.txt) and
[`screenlog-setup.txt`](screenlog-setup.txt) differ slightly from the
released version.
